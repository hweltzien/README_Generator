## Description
    After utilizing web-based resources and instructional support, I learned how to use node to interact with the file system, create an array of user input, handle file paths, and export a module. First, I installed "inquirer" and used index.js to generate an array of user input. Then, I provided a function to create the README file and initialize the app in index.js. From there, the purpose of generateMarkdown.js is to loop the data through the README template and export the module to the "dist" folder. Moreover, the README Generator simplifies and hastens the process of creating a README, which in turn helps those who may be interested in the user's repository understand their project. 

## Installation
    Run npm install in the terminal.
    
## Usage
    Run node index.js in the terminal.
